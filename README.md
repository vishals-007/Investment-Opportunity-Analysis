# Investment-Opportunity-Analysis
The primary objective of this project is to analyze the stocks of various companies and market trends to evaluate investment performance. By comparing the returns and risks of individual companies with the overall market risk, this analysis aims to provide valuable insights for investors. The project focuses on helping investors manage their portfolios by diversifying investments with optimized weightage across different stocks. This is achieved by comparing the risks and returns from a large number of companies globally, thereby enabling informed decision-making for better portfolio management.
